# Data Mining for Business Analytics: CIS 9660

## Overview
This repository contains all the activities, assignments, and Jupyter notebooks completed for the **Data Mining for Business Analytics** course (CIS 9660) at the **Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College**. The course, led by **Professor Vinayak Javaly**, provided a hands-on introduction to data mining concepts, machine learning algorithms, and Python tools for business analytics.

## Course Objectives
- Learn commonly used data mining algorithms.
- Understand how businesses use data mining to solve problems.
- Transform real-world data into datasets for modeling and analysis.
- Use tools such as Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn to train and evaluate models.
- Select appropriate modeling techniques to solve business problems.
- Understand ethical implications and unintended consequences of data mining and machine learning.
